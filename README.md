Hello, dear boyfriend. 
Welcome to the passage of my heart. 
Once you have enter this passage, you have no way out. Literally, no way. You live and die inside of this heart. I am literally kind of like freaking out actually because I do not know what to write to you to not sound lame. Okay, never mind that, I'm actually very cool, okay. Breathes. 

But before I could actually continue, can I ask a favor from you? 

What is the favor you may ask? 

Please keep that smile all the way from the start of this letter to the end of the letter, can you? 

Very well then. 

Be prepared. 

Park Jimin, it's your favorite Jeon Jungkook typing. I actually chose pink fonts for this letter but then I remembered before, you told me that your favorite colors are black and white, and also blue. But I reckoned that black and white for a beautiful letter may seemed too dull. So, blue was actually the perfect one. I hope its not too hard to read this font with this color, and also don't smile too hard. Do you remember the first day when we first met? Because I always do. Although not every words are vividly present in my mind, but all the memories are here, here in my head. First beginning, who would have thought that we would fall for each other? Ever heard of this quote? ''One day is ample time to fall in love''. And it coincidentally happened to me. I fell in love with my really whiny and cute boyfriend. 

The day when I first talked to you, you were my second friend that actually really care to have a conversation with me. The other was a Taetae hyung, he was really nice to me, but very boisterous, never mind about that anyways. He is not the main lead in this letter, you are. I was looking for someone to talk to right after I came back from a few months of not being in this crazy world, but then I found you. You appeared out of nowhere in my life, you just did.. How do I explain this but its crazy. I saw you on my suggestions to add friends and I happen to just add you, and never did I know that this one add or a one hello can turn everything into a simple romance. I never liked romance, but ever since I met you, my lips are itching to speak the most romantic words ever to you, not the three words, but something more than that. 

You are my romance. You are the sugar cubes to my bitter cup of coffee that I drink every morning. You are the pages I flip everyday wanting to know how this story may end. And I want to keep flipping them, I want to keep adding the sugar cubes, I want to read the story till the end, and I want to add the sugar cubes in my coffee till it turns sweet. Do you realize how I link both of two different category things together and it's still you? It will be impaired if all does not have each other. I like to read and have a cup of coffee at the same time so for me, if one is without the other, its like a human without the heart. You can't live without it. 

And I can't live without you. 

I hope you know by now that how much you mean to me, and I will always love you until you tell me to stop, which is never I assume. 

Ah.... breathes. I have so many things to say but I just don't know how to construct my sentences. I may be too early to write this letter to you but I wrote it on the 25th, afraid that I do not have much time to write for you till it reaches the 1st of April. And plus, I might be quite busy with school from this week till the next. But by the time, you read this I would be less busier so its good. 
This is actually my first time I've ever spend so much time and effort doing something for someone, you could tell that you are very important to me. I have no idea why I did not do this for my previous ex(s) but I hope you feel special, boyfriend. 

Look, now I'm digressing. Pinches his nose bridge. I was going to say that, when I first met you I was a little scared of you because there's one thing you told me before when I asked you what to say after all the greetings like hello. And you replied me with a, ask them how are they doing, ending with a question mark. And I was like, damn I don't think I would actually get along with this person. He sounded kinda aloof and I feel like you might end this friendship already. I also got quite scared that I wasn't interesting enough for you that you would end this conversation with me, so I tried to bring up a topic and thankfully you played along with me with that camera recorder, do you remember that? Doesn't it feels like it just happened a few days ago? 
For me, it does. It doesn't even feel real for me that I'm really, officially your boyfriend and you are legitimately mine. And after that, I found you really cute, really adorable, and I wanted to keep talking to you because you piqued my interest-- Maybe you might get annoyed with me for the upcoming days that we spend together, because cute may be the word you will keep hearing. 
The thing is if I actually really like you, I would call you cute or adorable, or maybe because you're just knocking on the door of my heart cutely, calling me to let you in. ''Hello, I'm Park Jimin! Nice to meet you, may I come in?'' My heart loses control and the door slowly creeps open for you to enter. 
That's when I know there's no going back. You are just really cute and adorable, ah, boyfriend. I once told everyone in the group that I like cute people, and I have never told you before that I met the cutest person alive on this planet earth, am I right? 

Guess who? It's you. You are so adorable that I am going to create a new word that only I can use that to call you when I mean that you're so adorable. Hm. Maybe the new word can be adoramin. Shrugs. That sounded so-- I don't know, does it sound lame? If it doesn't, then can I call you adoramin? I shall take silence as a yes. My little adoramin. Squishes your cheeks. 

I don't know how I actually could type this whole passage to you, because I usually do not do such stuffs. You told me that I'm very sweet but honestly speaking, I try my best, because I'm not a very sweet person, but you make my heart flutter, I guess I have to be truthful to you, and this is the only way to show my sincerity. I have nothing to offer you but just my sincere heart, and my company, I hope it's enough for you. I know that sometimes I talk to you half-way and I disappeared and made you wait for a few minutes, I have to apologize, that I get distracted very easily and it's not because you aren't entertaining at all. I just can't multi-task very well. I also do hope that this short span of time spent with me was fruitful and I really hope you enjoyed your time with me, because as much as I want to say, it was the best time of my life. 1 month with you, I could not ask for more, but just more time with you. Time flies, it's already 1 month with you, cheers to many more months of us. 


I love you a lot. 


Happy 1st Monthsary, ugly boyfriend. 

Please always keep in mind that I'm the limited edition boyfriend you can't find anywhere else, and I love you so much, just as much as you hate me. I honestly do not know if you're as excited as I am since I made this message a little way too early, but I am so eager to spend our 1st month together. Even after a year or two, my heart would still feel the same for you. 

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. 
Remember this? This means I will love you 4ever. And yes, I will. 


Happy 1st Monthsary once again. <3
